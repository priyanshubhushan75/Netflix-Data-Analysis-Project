# 📊 Netflix Data Analysis & Insights  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **Netflix dataset** to explore content trends, top actors, genres, release patterns, and more.  
Along with **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**, the project also applies **Machine Learning techniques** such as classification, clustering, sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems.  

The goal is to **uncover insights about Netflix’s content library** and practice **data visualization + ML concepts**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

### 📈 Visualizations
- **Top 10 Genres** – Bar chart of most common genres.  
- **Top 5 Directors / Actors** – Horizontal bar chart of most featured people.  
- **Content by Year** – Line plot showing growth of Netflix content over time (post-2010).  
- **Movies vs TV Shows** – Comparison of releases per year.  
- **USA-specific Trends** – Movies vs TV shows released in the USA after 2010.  
- **Average Duration** – Movies (in minutes) vs TV Shows (in seasons).  
- **Pie Chart of Genres** – Distribution of top genres.  
- **Dashboards** – Multi-chart dashboards with 6 plots (top countries, actors, years, ratings, longest movies, genres).
